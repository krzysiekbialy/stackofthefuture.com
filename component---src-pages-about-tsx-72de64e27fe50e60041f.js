My name is Artur Czemiel and I am a programming passionate. All the time I am trying to find the holy grail of full stack development. Many tried and many failed. However I think there is a possibility of creation of complicated systems that allow to deploy full stack web systems in very short time. This of course wouldnt be possible without graphsourcing which means creating the system basing on initial graph. That also means that every application should start from graph and the more you spend on desiging graph describing your application the better results you can achieve in shorter time. If anybody reading this shares the same idea I am open to contributions to this blog and the software I make."))))),Object(d.d)(m.a,null)))}}}]);
